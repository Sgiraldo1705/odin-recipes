    <p>The <strong>REAL</strong> American Cheesecake</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>For 8 Servings</p>
    <ul>
      <li>12 graham crackers, crushed</li>
      <li>½ cup butter(115 g), melted</li>
      <li>24 oz cream cheese(680 g), at room temperature</li>
      <li>¼ cup sugar(50 g)</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>hot water, for baking</li>
      <li>mixed berry, for garnish</li>
      <li>fresh mint, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Preparation</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC). Grease a 9-inch springform pan with
        nonstick spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, stir together the crushed graham crackers and melted
        butter until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the graham cracker mixture to the prepared pan and use the
        bottom of a dry measuring cup to press into an even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the crust for 20 minutes, or until starting to turn golden brown.
        Remove from the oven and let cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix together the cream cheese and sugar with an
        electric hand mixer until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating between each addition until
        incorporated. Add the vanilla and beat to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap the bottom of the springform pan tightly with aluminum foil. Place
        a paper towel in the bottom of a large, high-walled baking dish large
        enough to fit the springform pan. Place the springform pan in the baking
        dish and pour the cream cheese filling over the crust. Fill the baking
        dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the
        springform pan, being careful not to splash any into the cheesecake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 1 hour, or until slightly jiggly in the center and set around
        the edges. Remove from the oven and let cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>Refrigerate the cheesecake for 12 hours, or overnight.</li>
      <li>
        Release the springform and transfer the cheesecake to a serving platter.
        Garnish the top of the cheesecake with fresh berries, then slice and
        serve.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
